# Digit Recog

**Digit Recog** is a web application that uses *Tensorflow.js* to predict a user-drawn digit to the best of it's ability. The TensorFlow model was trained against 55000 data entries from the *[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)* database in order to increase the probability of correctly predicting the user-drawn image. 

This project was made in collaboration with [Sanjeev](https://github.com/sanjeev2001), [Ashanth](https://github.com/Ashxnth), and [Ricky](https://github.com/Ricky-H142) for Hack the Valley 4.

## Training Statistics
After training the model we found an acceptable accuracy based on the tested data and saved this model so that it can be used in the project.
